Hello! I'm Priya Keshari, a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer with a foundational
                        education in computer applications and hands-on experience in the dynamic world of web
                        development. With a Master's degree in Computer Application from School of Management
                        Sciences Varanasi, I have nurtured a solid academic base that has propelled me into
                        the practical realms of coding and development. My journey into the tech industry 
                        was marked by an enriching work at Paysing, where I was immersed in real-world
                        projects, working alongside seasoned professionals. This experience honed my skills in
                        both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to contribute effectively to 
                        building scalable and secure web applications.
